Being a *passion* driven person helps and hinders in many ways, but I still like seeing that in a light that allows me to push onwards; even in the times where my passion wanes.

Taking knowledge from so many different sources has its benifits, doing so has helped me attain perspective and understanding of many situations. Addititonally I've been able to contribute in **unique** and **interesting** ways to events and situations with different viewpoints or future proofing measures to make sure to stomp out any likelyhood of problems arising. 

It's also benificial to have a individual *methodology* to how you work, and I take a very logical approach to that when being productive. This unfortunately though doesn't always transfer over when being unproductive. Order from chaos is how we shape the world and make it better, my first step is ordering my own world and with that being able to set my affairs in order.
